# Go Training Overview
Why would I use Go? Maybe because you wer told to but more likely you're one of the cool kids and love awesome Gopher stickers.
No shame in that game. 

It's very possible you're coming into this from Ruby/Rails, PHP, or a JS background and you wanna know what all the fuss is about.

## Who should use this document?
We're trying to cover all the bases and intend this documentation to be followable for a complete noob (goob?). 
This training will be fleshed-out haphazardly at first but will generally follow a complete beginner to advanced flow. The documentation certainly will be laid out in that fashion but as we complete the cdocument we may work on some sections ahead of others.
Hit us up if you want to see something done before something else. We'll rule on a first-come-first-serve basis or simply whatever we feel like doing. 

Damn the man, save the empire.

## Why shouldn't I just use site.abc or site.xyz
You should. No one source will ever suffice. Theirs is probably better than ours.

## Starting Out
### Get Go
Go to [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/) and follow the directions to set it up on your system. 
If the documentation isn't clear to you (I still think it relies on a bit of insider know-how) hit us up on Github and we'll look into making our own documentation.

### Editors
* VimGo
* Gogland
* Whatever

### WTF is a workspace?
Yeah so if you're coming from a web programming background this idea of workspaces, GOROOT, etc may leave in a bit of a WTFM8 moment. 
No worries, we'll get you there.

## Going From Here
Check out our tutorials. We're trying to cover everything we can think of an are assuming zero knowledge of any programming or programming concepts and will cover them as in depth as we can.

Head over to the [Training Section](/training/index.md) to get started. If you already know some topics, skip 'em or come back if you need clarigication.

There are also actual Go file examples that you can look at, copy, print out as napkins, whatever. 
They're overly-commented in order to give whoever is looking at the code for the first time as much information as possible.
We may do versions that are less-commented too in case you find it annoying.
