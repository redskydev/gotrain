## Starting Out
### Variables
There are a couple different ways in Go to create variables. 
We can go the explicit route of creating a variable where we then assign a value later (this is useful at the top of functions to give the user an idea of what may be coming up)
We can default assign a value at declaration time (variable initialization), or
We can use short declaration so we don't have to type out the data type. To do this we use the _:=_ operator.

```go
// Basic Variable Declaration
var meaningOfLife int
meaningOfLife = 42

// Variable initialization
var testScore = 98

// Short Declaration
daysUntilGophercon := 67
```
### Data Types

An integer is a counting number - like 1,2,3,100, and even 0 and negative numbers -1, -42 etc.

Integers are declared without quotes
