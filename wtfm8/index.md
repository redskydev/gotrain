# FAQ AKA WTFM8
## Why would I use Go? 
Maybe because you wer told to but more likely you're one of the cool kids and love awesome Gopher stickers.
No shame in that game. 

It's very possible you're coming into this from Ruby/Rails, PHP, or a JS background and you wanna know what all the fuss is about.

## Who should use this document?
We're trying to cover all the bases and intend this documentation to be followable for a complete noob (goob?). 
This training will be fleshed-out haphazardly at first but will generally follow a complete beginner to advanced flow. The documentation certainly will be laid out in that fashion but as we complete the cdocument we may work on some sections ahead of others.
Hit us up if you want to see something done before something else. We'll rule on a first-come-first-serve basis or simply whatever we feel like doing. 

Damn the man, save the empire.

## Why shouldn't I just use site.abc or site.xyz
You should. No one source will ever suffice. Theirs is probably better than ours.

## Your documentation is full of typos
