# Data Types
In this section we'll cover some basic data types like integers, floats, and strings. 
If you're looking for more information on structures like arrays, slices, and structs, those each have their own dedicated page.

## Integers
An integer is a counting number - like 1,2,3,100, and even 0 and negative numbers -1, -42 etc.

Integers are declared without quotes i.e. you just type out the number. Anything in quotes (generally) will be considered a string which we'll get to shortly.

```go
age := 35
number_of_doggos := 12
```
## Floating Point
Floats, or floating point numbers, are numbers with decimals so this would be like 3.14, 98.6, 32.333 (repeating, of course) and they can alos be negative.

Floats, like integers, are declared without quotes.

```go
pi_ish := 3.141592653589
chance_of_survival := 32.333
```

## Strings

### Arrays

### Slices
